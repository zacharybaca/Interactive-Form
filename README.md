# Interactive Form Validation

1. The form should display validation errors if certain criteria is not met, or required fields are left empty.
2. In order to test the form for validation, since the project wasn't running on a local server and was being served as a webpage, I had to reload the form after submitting values so the form knew that a value was entered. If I were to just reload the form and type characters into a field and tried to submit the form, the form wouldn't recognize the new values until a page refresh.
